# LSB-IMAGE-STEGNOGRAPHY
A C-based implementation of LSB (Least Significant Bit) Image Steganography for secure data hiding in images. Supports encryption, message embedding, and extraction through a command-line interface.




This project demonstrates a research-oriented implementation of LSB (Least Significant Bit) Image Steganography using the C programming language. It allows secure embedding of secret messages inside digital images without noticeable visual distortion. The system enhances data confidentiality by applying encryption before embedding and provides both encoding and decoding functionalities. Designed as a minimal yet extendable implementation, it offers a strong foundation for learning, experimentation, and future cryptographic steganography research.
